## ASSIGNMENT 1 : Due on 09th December 2023

### Question 1 (4 marks)
In the binary _prob_1_, identify the following: 
(i). number of parameters passed to _add1()_ and their values (1 mark)
(ii). return value of _add_1()_ (1 mark)
(iii). logic of _add_1()_ expressed in terms of the parameter it received (2 marks)

### Question 2 (2 marks)
You have been given the binary _prob_2_, which initializes an array of 10 elements within a loop. But the loop exits after initializing only the first 2 elements. You should identify which instruction in function _init_array()_ should be changed so that the loop initializes all the 10 elements of the array. 

### Question 3 (4 marks)
Yo have been given 4 binaries: _prob_3_a_, _prob_3_b_, _prob_3_c_, _prob_3_d_. Each of them contains a particular control structure logic in the function _identify_control_structure_. You should identify which control structure logic is present within that function. For example, whether it is a for loop or if-else.
